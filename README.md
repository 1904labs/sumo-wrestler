## Getting Started

This project uses [Pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) for package and virtual environment management. 

From the root of this project

Install dependencies
```
pipenv install
```

Activate virtual environment (and apply environment variables from .env file)
```
pipenv shell
```

Deactivating virtual environment
```
exit
```
(`deactivate` will mess up pipenv)
